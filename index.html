        <p>Washington DC has been in a long fight for fair representation in Congress. It’s time for this country to rightfully recognize Washington DC as a state and give the people of the great region the power and voice that they have been denied for far too long. DC residents have been contributing more than their fair share to the country, from GDP and federal taxes, to history, culture, and higher education.</p>

        <p>Much like how the great ancient city of Alexandria in Egypt was a beacon for knowledge and thought, Washington DC, our dear nation’s capital, has the opportunity to become a beacon of freedom and democracy for people 2000 years from now. This is a rare opportunity that we’re presented with; knowing that we can leave a mark on history and allow future generations to learn from us and our many mistakes so that they can make further improvements to their world.</p>
